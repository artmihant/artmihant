### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Artem Antonov

I am a senior programmer at Fidesys corp. We make the best CAE package in Russia [CAE-Fidesys](https://cae-fidesys.com/), and I personally create the best cloud service for this package [ProveDesign](https://prove.design).

Same way, I teach classes in [math circles at Moscow State University](http://mmmf.msu.ru/) and I like to program interesting mathematical things.

I know and love Python and JavaScript and love and know a little Haskell, C and PHP.

If you are interested in my person, you may be curious to look at my articles on [Habr](https://habr.com/ru/users/celen/posts/)
